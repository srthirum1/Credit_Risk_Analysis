# Credit_Risk_Analysis

#Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

- In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk.
We adopted the following procedure:

- oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

We will evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

#Results:
The balanced accuracy score is 65%.
The high_risk precision is about 1% only with 62% sensitivity which makes a F1 of 2% only.
Due to the high number of the low_risk population, its precision is almost 100% with a sensitivity of 68%.


#Summary:

All the models used to perform the credit risk analysis show weak precision in determining if a credit risk is high.
The Ensemble models brought a lot more improvment specially on the sensitivity of the high risk credits.
The EasyEnsembleClassifier model shows a recall of 92% so it detects almost all high risk credit. But this still allows for areas to not detect risk.
I would not recommend to use any models at all.
